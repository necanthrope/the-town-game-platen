  This is an example site for digital books, built on Platen!
---

This is a place with some very good games I made. It uses hugo and markdown to turn some plaintext
drafts into a website.

You can install this website as an app, it's a fully functional PWA!

You can checkout two different versions of Picaroons, either via the menu or these links:

1. [Picaroons as a multi-page project](/picaroons)
1. [Picaroons as a single-page project](/picaroons-sp)

You can also checkout the blog via the menu or [this link](/posts).

While not currently implemented, you can include multiple language versions of your site and switch
between them via the menu.
